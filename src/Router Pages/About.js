        Education system Up until 1976, education policies and implementation
        were determined legally by each of India's constitutional states. The
        42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent
        subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared
        formal responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a
        country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union
        territories, this means that the potential for variations between states
        in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary
        education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created
        to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
        State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of
        primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed
        elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion
        managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools
        offering elementary education (Grades 18) were managed by government and
        16.86% of schools were under private management (excluding children in
        unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee
        Scheme and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed
        privately, one third are 'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment
        in Grades 18 is shared between government and privately managed schools
        in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20)
        and in urban areas much lower (36:66).[7]
